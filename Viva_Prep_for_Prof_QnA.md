# 📚 STOCK VOLATILITY ML PROJECT - PROFESSOR Q&A CHEAT SHEET

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW
**What is this project?**
- Predicting stock market volatility (Low/Medium/High) using machine learning
- Uses historical stock prices, volume, and gold prices as features
- Classification problem with 3 classes

---

## 1️⃣ FEATURE IMPORTANCE ANALYSIS

### What is it?
Shows which input features (Open, Close, Volume, etc.) contribute most to predictions.

### Why did you add it?
To understand which market indicators are most influential in detecting volatility.

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: "How is feature importance calculated?"**
A: Random Forest calculates it by measuring how much each feature reduces prediction error across all decision trees. Features that reduce error more get higher importance scores.

**Q: "Why is [X feature] more important than [Y feature]?"**
A: The model found that [X feature] provides more discriminative power in separating volatility classes. For example, Volume might be more important because trading volume often spikes during high volatility periods.

**Q: "What would you do with this information?"**
A: I could remove low-importance features to simplify the model, or collect more data for high-importance features to improve predictions.

## 2️⃣ CORRELATION HEATMAP

### What is it?
A visual matrix showing how features are related to each other (-1 to +1).

### Why did you add it?
To identify redundant features and understand feature relationships.

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: "What does correlation mean?"**
A: Correlation measures linear relationship between two variables:
   - +1 = Perfect positive correlation (both increase together)
   - -1 = Perfect negative correlation (one increases, other decreases)
   - 0 = No linear relationship

**Q: "Why are Open/High/Low/Close highly correlated?"**
A: They're all price-based features from the same day, so they naturally move together. If opening price is high, closing price is likely high too.

**Q: "Is high correlation a problem?"**
A: Yes, it's called multicollinearity. Highly correlated features don't add new information and can make the model unstable. But Random Forest handles this well.

## 3️⃣ MODEL COMPARISON

### What is it?
Training and comparing 4 different ML algorithms on the same dataset.

### Why did you add it?
To find the best algorithm for this specific problem and justify my choice.

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: "Why did Random Forest perform better than Logistic Regression?"**
A: 
- Random Forest can capture non-linear patterns (stock volatility is non-linear)
- Uses ensemble of multiple trees, reducing overfitting
- Logistic Regression assumes linear relationships, which don't exist in stock data

**Q: "Explain each algorithm briefly"**
A:
- **Random Forest**: Builds multiple decision trees and votes on final prediction
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear model for classification, assumes linear decision boundary
- **Decision Tree**: Single tree that splits data based on feature thresholds
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Classifies based on K closest training examples

**Q: "Why is Decision Tree faster but less accurate than Random Forest?"**
A: Decision Tree is a single tree (fast to train), but prone to overfitting. Random Forest uses 100 trees (slower) but averages their predictions, which is more robust.

**Q: "What is F1-Score?"**
A: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. Better than accuracy for imbalanced datasets.
   - F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

## 4️⃣ TECHNICAL INDICATORS (FEATURE ENGINEERING)

### What is it?
Adding 5 new features derived from existing price/volume data.

### Why did you add it?
To give the model domain-specific knowledge that traders use.

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: "What is a Moving Average?"**
A: Average of prices over last N days. Smooths out noise to show trends.
   - MA-5: Short-term trend (last 5 days)
   - MA-20: Long-term trend (last 20 days)

**Q: "How does Moving Average help prediction?"**
A: 
- If MA-5 > MA-20 → Upward trend (bullish)
- If MA-5 < MA-20 → Downward trend (bearish)
- Crossovers often signal volatility changes

**Q: "What is Rate of Change (ROC)?"**
A: Percentage change in price over last N days. Measures momentum.
   - ROC = ((Price_today - Price_N_days_ago) / Price_N_days_ago) × 100

**Q: "What is Price Range and why is it useful?"**
A: High - Low for the day. Measures intraday volatility directly. Higher range = higher volatility.

**Q: "Did these features improve the model?"**
A: Yes, accuracy improved from [X]% to [Y]% after adding technical indicators, because they capture patterns that traders use.

## 5️⃣ CROSS-VALIDATION

### What is it?
K-Fold validation - splitting data into K parts, training K times, each time testing on different part.

### Why did you add it?
To get more reliable performance estimate than single train-test split.

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: "Why not just use train-test split?"**
A: Single split might be lucky/unlucky. Cross-validation tests on multiple splits, giving more reliable average performance.

**Q: "Explain 5-Fold Cross-Validation"**
A: 
1. Split data into 5 equal parts
2. Train on 4 parts, test on 1 part → Get accuracy
3. Rotate which part is test set
4. Repeat 5 times
5. Average the 5 accuracies

**Q: "What does standard deviation tell you?"**
A: How consistent the model is across different data splits. Low std = stable model.

**Q: "What is the 95% confidence interval?"**
A: Mean ± 2×std. We're 95% confident the true accuracy falls in this range.

## 6️⃣ LEARNING CURVES

### What is it?
Plot showing training accuracy vs validation accuracy as dataset size increases.

### Why did you add it?
To diagnose if model is overfitting, underfitting, or just right.

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: "How do you interpret learning curves?"**
A: Three scenarios:
1. **Converging curves** (good) → Model is well-tuned
2. **Large gap** → Overfitting (memorizing training data)
3. **Both curves low** → Underfitting (model too simple)

**Q: "What is overfitting?"**
A: Model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns. Performs well on training but poorly on new data.

**Q: "What is underfitting?"**
A: Model is too simple to capture patterns. Performs poorly on both training and test data.

**Q: "If curves plateau, what does it mean?"**
A: Adding more data won't help much. Need better features or different algorithm.

**Q: "How would you fix overfitting?"**
A: 
- Reduce model complexity (fewer trees, lower depth)
- Add more training data
- Use regularization
- Remove noisy features

## 7️⃣ PREDICTION ERROR ANALYSIS

### What is it?
Analyzing which predictions are wrong and why.

### Why did you add it?
To identify model weaknesses and areas for improvement.

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: "Which class has most errors?"**
A: [Check your results] - Usually "Medium" because it's between Low and High, harder to distinguish.

**Q: "How would you reduce errors?"**
A: 
- Collect more training data for error-prone classes
- Add features that better distinguish those classes
- Try different algorithms
- Ensemble methods (combine multiple models)

## 📊 KEY METRICS TO KNOW

**Accuracy** = (Correct Predictions) / (Total Predictions)
- Simple but can be misleading with imbalanced data

**Precision** = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
- Of all positive predictions, how many were correct?

**Recall** = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
- Of all actual positives, how many did we catch?

**F1-Score** = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- Balanced metric considering both precision and recall

**Confusion Matrix:**
```
                Predicted
              Low  Med  High
Actual Low    TP   FP   FP
       Med    FN   TP   FP
       High   FN   FN   TP
```
